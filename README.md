# First_bot

I developed my first Discord Bot using Python. It can parse a CSV file which contains data about satellites. 
By running a given command from Discord, the bot send a matplotlib graph reprensenting the distribution of launched satellites among Nasa, US Navy, SpaceX.

The bot also provides other features that I let you browse in the code.
